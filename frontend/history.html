        <h2>The Rich History of Kuria</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">From Ancient Roots to Modern Resilience</p>
        
        <div class="history-content">
            <h3>Our Origins and Early Life</h3>
            <p>
                The Kuria people, also known as Abakuria, have a deep-rooted history in East Africa, 
                primarily residing in the border regions of Kenya and Tanzania. 
                Our ancestors were skilled agriculturalists and pastoralists, 
                thriving on the fertile lands and rich cultural traditions that have been passed down through generations. 
                Early Kuria society was organized around clans, with strong communal bonds and a rich oral tradition preserving our heritage.
            </p>

            <h3>The Colonial Period and Border Formation</h3>
            <p>
                The late 19th and early 20th centuries brought significant changes with the advent of colonial rule. The arbitrary drawing of colonial borders by European powers, 
                specifically the British and Germans, divided the Kuria community. 
                This division, which established the Kenya-Tanzania border, 
                cut through ancestral lands and separated families, 
                creating a unique cross-border identity for the Kuria people. 
                Despite the political division, cultural ties and interactions continued, 
                albeit with new challenges.
            </p>

            <h3>Separation with Tanzanian Kurians</h3>
            <p>
                The formalization of the border led to distinct administrative and national identities for Kurians on either side. 
                While sharing a common language (Ekikuria) and cultural practices, 
                the Kenyan Kuria and Tanzanian Kuria developed under different national policies and socio-economic frameworks. 
                This separation, however, has not erased the strong sense of kinship and shared heritage that continues to bind the community across national lines. 
                Efforts to maintain cultural exchange and family connections remain a vital part of Kuria life.
            </p>

            <h3>Agricultural and Economic Activities</h3>
            <p>
                Historically, agriculture has been the backbone of the Kuria economy. 
                Our people are renowned for cultivating various crops, including maize, millet, sorghum, and cassava, alongside cash crops like tobacco and coffee. 
                Livestock keeping, particularly cattle, also plays a crucial role, symbolizing wealth and social status. 
                In recent times, there has been a diversification into small-scale businesses, cross-border trade, and engagement in formal employment, 
                contributing to the region's economic growth while preserving traditional livelihoods.
            </p>
            <p>
                The entrepreneurial spirit of the Kuria people is evident in the bustling local markets and the growing number of small and medium-sized enterprises. 
                These activities not only provide sustenance but also foster community cohesion and cultural expression through shared labor and trade.
